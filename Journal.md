I had a lot of doubts about this homework on the way to doing it. 
From what I was going to do and why the class was doing this. 
In class, I was following the professor's idea and looking what he did,
but in the process of programming myself, I didn't know where to start.
For example, at the very beginning, after downloading the background code
for the assignment, what should I do first? Do I run npm first? When I write 
put route, I have more questions. I felt that everything was clear during 
the course, but when it came to my own assignments, I was at a loss for words
By the way, I use wholw day looking to how to push to github.
